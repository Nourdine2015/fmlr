\usage{
bar_volume_runs(dat, v_0 = 20, w0 = 10, bkw_T = 5, bkw_Pb1 = 5,
  bkw_V = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{dat input with at least the following column: Price, Size}

\item{v_0}{average volume for each trade, and it is used to create the first bar}

\item{w0}{the time window length of the first bar}

\item{bkw_T}{backward window length when using pracma::movavg for exponentially weighted average T}

\item{bkw_Pb1}{backward window length when using pracma::movavg for exponentially weighted average P[b_t=1]}

\item{bkw_V}{backward window length for exponentially weighted average volumes}
}
\value{
a list of vectors for HLOCV of volume runs bars. Note that the remaining data after the latest ending time point detected will be formed as a bar.
